## Relation to CCTweaks?
This mod has nothing to do with CCTweaks, though there is no denying the name is a throwback to it. That being said,
several features have been included, such as full block modems, the Cobalt runtime and map-like rendering for pocket
computers.


## Known Issues
Main Known issue
* Mods that add blocks that can be used as peripherals for CC:T On forge, dont work with CC:R.
	* This is because of the differences between forge and fabric, and that mod devs, to my knowledge have not agreed upon a standard method in which to implement cross compatibility between mods,
* Storage Peripherals throw a java "StackOverflowError" when using `pushItems()`, 
    * Work around, you are probably using `pushItems(chest, 1)` or simular. please use `pushItems(chest, 1, nil, 1)`. 

## Known Working mods that add Peripherals
* Please let me know of other mods that work with this one
	* Better End
	* Better Nether
